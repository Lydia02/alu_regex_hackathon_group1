 ## Project Overview

This Web Application leverages a custom-built API that aggregates data from numerous web pages, processing strings to extract information based on predefined Regular Expression patterns. The engine is designed to recognize and parse data types such as movie titles, song lyrics, and more, making it an invaluable tool for data analysis and content aggregation.

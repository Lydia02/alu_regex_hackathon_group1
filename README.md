 ## Project Outline

This Web Application leverages a custom-built API that aggregates data from numerous web pages, processing strings to extract information based on predefined Regular Expression patterns. The system is designed to recognize and parse data types such as movie titles, song lyrics, and more, making it an invaluable tool for data analysis and content aggregation.

### Features of the Web Application

- **Dynamic Data Extraction**: Utilizes Regex to efficiently parse and extract varied data types from text.
- **Customizable Patterns**: Offers the flexibility to modify and expand Regex patterns to suit evolving data extraction needs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Created to handle large volumes of data, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **User-Centric Design**: Provides a straightforward interface for users to specify their data extraction requirements.

### Technical Specifications

- **Languages**: HTML,CSS, and Javascript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Node.js for backend operations 
- **Data Management**: JSON files for storing Regex patterns and potentially extracted data for demonstration purposes
- **Security Measures**: Implements basic security best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

This segment guides you through setting up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (optional, if backend functionality is extended beyond static file serving)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lydia02/alu_regex_hackathon_group1.git
cd alu_regex_hackathon_group1
```

2. **Install Dependencies** 

```bash
Run live server
node run
```


### Usage Examples

- **Extracting Movie Titles**: Navigate to the Movie Titles section, enter your text data or specify a URL for data fetching, and observe the extracted titles based on the specified Regex pattern.
- **Analyzing Song Lyrics**: Use the Song Lyrics pattern to parse through provided lyrics text, extracting verses or chorus lines as defined.
- This can be used on all the data.

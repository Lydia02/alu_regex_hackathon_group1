 ## Project Outline

This Web Application leverages a custom-built API that aggregates data from numerous web pages, processing strings to extract information based on predefined Regular Expression patterns. The system is designed to recognize and parse data types such as movie titles, song lyrics, and more, making it an invaluable tool for data analysis and content aggregation.

### Features of the Web Application

- **Dynamic Data Extraction**: Utilizes Regex to efficiently parse and extract varied data types from text.
- **Customizable Patterns**: Offers the flexibility to modify and expand Regex patterns to suit evolving data extraction needs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Created to handle large volumes of data, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **User-Centric Design**: Provides a straightforward interface for users to specify their data extraction requirements.

### Technical Specifications

- **Languages**: HTML,CSS, and Javascript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Node.js for backend operations 
- **Data Management**: JSON files for storing Regex patterns and potentially extracted data for demonstration purposes
- **Security Measures**: Implements basic security best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

This segment guides you through setting up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (optional, if backend functionality is extended beyond static file serving)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lydia02/alu_regex_hackathon_group1.git
cd alu_regex_hackathon_group1
```

2. **Install Dependencies** 

```bash
Run live server
node run
```


### Usage Examples

- **Extracting Movie Titles**: Navigate to the Movie Titles section, enter your text data or specify a URL for data fetching, and observe the extracted titles based on the specified Regex pattern.
- **Analyzing Song Lyrics**: Use the Song Lyrics pattern to parse through provided lyrics text, extracting verses or chorus lines as defined.
- This can be used on all the data.
  
To include a section on how the project works on a live server, especially for those who might not be familiar with setting up local development environments or using live servers, you can add a section titled "Running on a Live Server" in your README.md. This section can guide users through starting a live server to view and interact with the project in their browser.

## Running on a Live Server

After setting up the project locally, you can run it on a live server to interact with the web application in real-time. This process will serve your project files on a local web server, making it accessible through a web browser.

### Using Visual Studio Code Live Server

If you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your IDE, you can use the Live Server extension to quickly start a server.

1. **Install Live Server Extension**:
   - Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Live Server" and click on the install button.

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open the project folder in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder and selecting the `alu_regex_hackathon_group1` directory.

3. **Start Live Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code explorer and select "Open with Live Server", or click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom right of the VS Code window.
   - Your default web browser will open, and the project will be served from a local URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

### Accessing the Web Application

- Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Live Server or `http-server`. You should now see the project running and can interact with the web application.
- Navigate through the application sections to test different Regex patterns and data types as per the project's features.

This setup enables real-time interaction with the project, allowing you to view changes live as you modify files or experiment with different Regular Expressions.

## Conclusion
The project stands out for its innovative approach to data handling. It offers a scalable architecture that can accommodate various data types â€” from movie titles and song lyrics to more structured data like ISBN numbers and others. This versatility showcases the project's potential to serve many users, from data analysts to casual web surfers seeking specific information.
In conclusion, the ALU Regex Hackathon Group 1 project is more than just a technical endeavour; it's a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of simplifying complexity. As we look to the future, the project stands as a foundation upon which endless possibilities can be built.
